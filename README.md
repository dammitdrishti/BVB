Project Overview: Bhavan's Institute (Bhopal Kendra)
This repository contains a bespoke, editorial-grade digital experience for Bhavan’s Institute of Communication & Management (BICM), Bhopal. Moving away from traditional educational templates, this project implements an asymmetrical, high-contrast UI/UX strategy to reflect the institution’s dual heritage of Indian cultural values and modern professional training.

Core Objectives
Modernizing Heritage: Translating the vision of founder Kulapati K. M. Munshi—"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"—into a modern digital landscape.


Professional Clarity: Showcasing specialized PG Diploma programs in Human Resources, Digital Media, and International Trade through a "Bento Box" grid system for maximum scannability.


Engagement: Featuring the "Bouddhik Samwad" (Intellectual Dialogue) series, highlighting lectures from high-ranking retired officials on global and national challenges .

Technical Architecture & Design Philosophy
Asymmetrical Layouts: Utilizing broken grids and offset elements to create visual tension and guide the eye intentionally, avoiding the "Bootstrap fatigue" of standard grids.


Typography as UI: Extreme contrast between high-end Display Serif headings and technical Space Mono labels to denote precision in academic schedules (e.g., the 150-hour contact cycles).

Performance-First: Built with a minimal Tailwind CSS footprint and vanilla JavaScript for micro-interactions, ensuring the "glassmorphism" effects don't compromise load speeds.

Active Whitespace: Using expansive negative space to frame the prestigious Board of Members, including Chairman Shri S.K. Rout, IPS (retd) and Secretary Shri Salil Chatterjee.

Key Sections Implemented

The Hero: A typographic mask featuring the Bhopal Kendra branding.


Course Bento: Distinct modules for IRPM (HRM), Journalism, and Import-Export procedures.

The Global Reach Map: A data-driven section detailing Bhavan’s 367 constituent institutions and 119 centers.
